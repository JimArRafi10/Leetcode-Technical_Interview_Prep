## Two Pointers
 *The Two Pointers algorithm is a common technique used in computer science and data structures for solving problems involving arrays or sequences. It is particularly useful when dealing with problems that require searching, sorting, or processing elements in an array or list.

The basic idea behind the Two Pointers algorithm is to use two pointers, often referred to as "left" and "right" pointers, to traverse the array or list from different positions simultaneously. These pointers can move towards each other, away from each other, or in some specific way depending on the problem requirements.

Here are some common scenarios where the Two Pointers algorithm is employed:

1. **Two Sum Problem**: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum. You can use two pointers to scan the array from both ends towards the center.

2. **Three Sum Problem**: Find all unique triplets in an array that add up to a given sum. Two pointers can be used in conjunction with sorting the array.

3. **Container With Most Water**: Given an array of heights representing the walls of containers, find the container with the most water. Two pointers can be used to start from the two ends and move towards each other, adjusting based on the height of the walls.

4. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array using Two Pointers without using extra space. This can be done by starting from the end of both arrays and placing the larger element at the correct position.

5. **Linked List Cycle Detection**: Detect a cycle in a linked list using two pointers, one slow and one fast, which move at different speeds.

6. **Palindrome Checking**: Check if a given string is a palindrome using two pointers starting from both ends and moving towards the center while comparing characters.

7. **Longest Subarray with Sum K**: Find the length of the longest subarray with a sum equal to K. Two pointers can be used to maintain a sliding window.



The Two Pointers algorithm can be an efficient way to solve various array-related problems, often with a time complexity of O(N) or better, depending on the specific problem and its requirements.
